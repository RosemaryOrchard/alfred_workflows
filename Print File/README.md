# File Action: Print

To add this you need to download two files:

- `print-selected.workflow`
- `Print Selected File(s).alfredworkflow`

Move `print-selected.workflow` to iCloud Drive > Automator (create the Automator folder if you don't have it). If you want to put the file somewhere else you will need to edit the script action inside the Alfred Workflow.

Now, when you want to print a file from Alfred the option is available to you! (Please note, printer not provided.)
